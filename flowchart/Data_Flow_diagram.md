Here is the **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** for your system. I'll provide both **Level-1** and **Level-2** DFDs to break down how data flows through the entire process.

### **Level-1 DFD**
This diagram provides an overview of the main components of the system and how data flows between them.

    A[Student Uploads Answer Sheet] --> B{OCR Engine}
    B --> C[Extracted Text Data]
    C --> D[NLP Model]
    D --> E[Evaluated Answer Data]
    E --> F[Knowledge Gap Detection]
    F --> G[Personalized Feedback]
    G --> H[Generated Learning Resources]
    H --> I[Feedback Delivery]
    I --> J[Student Insights & Learning]
    J --> K[Track Progress and Close Gaps]
    K --> L[End Process]
    
    A -.->|Submit Answer Sheet| 1[Student System Interface]
    B -.->|Data Request| 2[Database for Answer Key/Model]
    I -.->|User Interaction| 3[Student System Interface]
```

### **Explanation of Level-1**:
- **Student Uploads Answer Sheet**: The student submits their handwritten answer sheet.
- **OCR Engine**: The system uses OCR to extract the text from the image.
- **NLP Model**: The system processes the extracted text and compares it to the answer key or model.
- **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Areas where the student struggled are detected.
- **Personalized Feedback & Learning Resources**: Feedback is generated, and learning resources (videos, quizzes) are created.
- **Feedback Delivery**: The feedback and resources are provided to the student.
- **Tracking Progress**: Student progress is tracked for continuous improvement.



### **Level-2 DFD**
This diagram breaks down the internal processes into more detail.

    C --> D{Text Segmentation}
    D --> E[Answer Segmentation]
    D --> F[Question Segmentation]
    
    E --> G[NLP Model]
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Answer Evaluation]
    H --> I{Compare Answer to Key}
    I --> J[Detected Knowledge Gaps]
    I --> K[Correct Answers Identified]
    
    J --> L[Personalized Feedback Generation]
    L --> M[Generate Learning Resources: Videos, Notes, Quizzes]
    M --> N[Feedback Delivery System]
    
    N --> O[Provide Feedback to Student]
    O --> P[Track Student Progress]
    P --> Q[Close Knowledge Gaps]
    
    O -.->|Student Interaction| R[Student Feedback Interface]
    Q -.->|Request Model Feedback| 2[Feedback Database]
```

### **Explanation of Level-2**:
1. **OCR Engine**: Extracts text from the image, which is further segmented into individual answers and questions.
2. **NLP Model**: Processes each answer using natural language processing techniques to evaluate its correctness.
3. **Answer Evaluation**: Compares answers against the key, detects knowledge gaps, and identifies correct answers.
4. **Feedback Generation**: Uses detected gaps to create personalized feedback and generate relevant learning resources like videos, notes, and quizzes.
5. **Feedback Delivery**: Delivers personalized feedback and learning resources to the student via an interface.
6. **Progress Tracking**: Tracks the studentâ€™s progress and suggests further resources if required.

In this diagram, **data flows between modules** (like OCR, NLP, Feedback Generation) and the **system interfaces** (for interaction with students), while feedback and progress are stored in a **database** for further tracking.

    M --> N[Feedback Delivery System]
    
    N --> O[Provide Feedback to Student]
    O --> P[Track Student Progress]
    P --> Q[Close Knowledge Gaps]
    
    O -.->|Student Interaction| R[Student Feedback Interface]
    Q -.->|Request Model Feedback| 2[Feedback Database]
```

### Key Features:
- **Modules**: OCR, NLP, Answer Evaluation, Knowledge Gap Detection, Feedback Generation, and Delivery.
- **External Interfaces**: Student system interface for submission and interaction, database for feedback tracking.

These DFDs will help visually communicate how data moves through the system and the relationships between different components.
