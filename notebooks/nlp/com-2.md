# --- 3.9 Evaluation (Simplified Example) ---
# (Requires labeled data and more sophisticated metrics)
# In a real research setting, you would have a dataset of student answers 
# annotated by experts for knowledge gaps.  You would then calculate precision, 
# recall, and F1-score by comparing your system's output to the expert annotations.

# Example (Illustrative - needs real data):
true_positives = 5  # Correctly identified knowledge gaps
false_positives = 2  # Incorrectly identified knowledge gaps
false_negatives = 3  # Missed knowledge gaps

precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
f1 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)

print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
print(f"F1-score: {f1}")


# --- Implementing more advanced techniques ---
# * For semantic similarity, explore Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for better sentence embeddings.
# * For QA, integrate a real QA system like BERT QA using libraries like transformers.
# * For topic modeling, experiment with different LDA parameters or try other techniques like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
# * For NER, train a custom NER model on a domain-specific dataset.
# * Use cross-validation or other robust evaluation methods.
# * Consider incorporating external knowledge bases or ontologies to improve knowledge gap detection.

# --- Accuracy Evaluation ---
# * Create a gold standard dataset of student answers annotated by experts.
# * Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to evaluate your system's performance.
# * Compare your system's performance to baseline models or existing methods.
# * Conduct statistical significance tests to determine if your results are statistically significant.

# --- Where to put more technology/models ---
# * In the Semantic Similarity section (3.6.2), you can explore different word/sentence embedding models.
# * In the QA System Integration section (3.6.4), you can integrate a powerful QA system.
# * In the Topic Modeling section (3.4), you can try different topic modeling algorithms.
# * In the NER section (3.3), you can train a custom NER model.

# --- Visual Graphs ---
# * Bar charts for comparing TF-IDF scores.
# * Knowledge graphs to visualize relationships between concepts.
# * Confusion matrices to visualize the performance of your knowledge gap detection system.
# * Line graphs to show the impact of different parameters on your system's performance.

# --- Further Improvements ---
# * Error analysis: Analyze the errors made by your system to identify areas for improvement.
# * User studies: Conduct user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of your feedback generation system.
# * Integration with LMS: Integrate your system with a Learning Management System (LMS) to make it more accessible to educators.

**Detailed Instructions and Explanations:**

1. **Environment Setup:** Install the necessary libraries: `nltk`, `spacy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`.  Download the required NLTK data and spaCy model as shown in the code.

2. **Data Collection and Annotation:** Gather a dataset of handwritten student answers.  Crucially, have *experts* annotate these answers, marking the specific knowledge gaps present. This annotated dataset is your "gold standard" for evaluation.  Consider using a tool like brat or Label Studio to facilitate annotation.  Calculate inter-annotator agreement (e.g., using Cohen's Kappa) to ensure the reliability of your annotations.

3. **OCR:** Use Google Cloud Document AI or Vision API (or a similar service) to digitize the handwritten answers *before* running this code.  The output of the OCR should be plain text files, one for each student answer.

4. **Code Implementation:**
   - The provided code implements the NLP pipeline steps.
   - Replace the example `student_answer` and `correct_answer` with real data from your dataset.
   - The `preprocess_text` function handles text cleaning.
   - The code demonstrates semantic similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.  *Consider trying Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for potentially better sentence embeddings.*
   - The QA system integration is *simplified*.  *You must integrate a real QA system
